**Current Release:** 0.1-MVP (23/12/2014)

IdE enhances existing institution identities for users undertaking research activities in the Australian Higher Education sector by specifically identifying these users as a â€˜researchersâ€™.

NeCTAR funded Virtual Laboratories (VL) and other AAF connected services will be able to use this information to make informed access control decisions specifically for researchers.

## Remote Access

Documentation for developers wishing to use the [IdE RESTful API is available](doc/api/v1/README.md). Server details will be provided by the AAF once deployment to the test federation is completed.

Documentation for developers wishing to use IdE support for the Shibboleth [Simple Aggregation](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPAttributeResolver#NativeSPAttributeResolver-SimpleAggregationAttributeResolver) profile will be provided by the AAF once deployment to the test federation is completed.
